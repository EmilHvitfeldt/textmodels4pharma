## Aardvark Classification and Evolution
## Aardvarks are small pig-like mammals that are
found inhabiting a wide range of different
habitats throughout Africa, south of the Sahara.
They are mostly solitary and spend their days
sleeping in underground burrows to protect them
from the heat of the African sun, emerging in the
cooler evening to search for food. Their name
originates from the Afrikaans language in South
Africa and means Earth Pig, due to their long
snout and pig-like body. Aardvarks are unique
among animals as they are the only surviving
species in their animal family. Until recently it
was widely believed that they were most closely
related to other insectivores such as armadillos
and pangolins but this is not the case with their
closest living relatives actually thought to be
elephants.
## Aardvark Anatomy and Appearance
## Aardvarks have a unique appearance amongst
mammals (and indeed all animals) as they display
physical characteristics of a number of different
animal species. They have medium-sized, almost
hairless bodies and long snouts that make them
look distinctly pig-like at first, with thick
skin that both protects them from the hot sun and
also from being harmed by insect bites. They are
able to close their nostrils to stop dust and
insects from entering their nose. They have
tubular, rabbit-like ears that can stand on end
but can also be folded flat to prevent dirt from
entering them when they are underground.
Aardvarks have strong, claws on each of their
spade-like feet that along with the fact that
their hind legs are longer than their front legs,
makes them strong and capable diggers able to
excavate vast amounts of earth at an alarming
rate. Due to the fact that they spend most of
their lives underground or out hunting in the
dark at night, they have poor eyesight but are
able to easily navigate their surrounding using
their excellent sense of smell to both find prey
and to sense potential danger.
## Aardvark Distribution and Habitat
## Aardvarks are found in a wide variety of
different habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa
from dry deserts to the moist rainforest regions.
The only stipulation (other than having good
access to plenty of food and water) is to have
good soil in which they can dig their extensive
burrows. Despite being highly skilled at digging
in sandy or clay soil types, rockier regions
prove more of a challenge to create their
underground homes so the aardvark will move to
another area where soil conditions are better
suited to digging. Their burrows can be up to 10
meters (33 ft) long in a home range that can be
anywhere from 2 to 5 kilometres square. Their
burrows often having multiple entrances and are
always left head first so they are able to
identify potential predators easily using their
keen sense of smell.
## Aardvark Behaviour and Lifestyle
## Aardvarks are mainly solitary animals that
come together only to mate and are never found in
large groups. They live in underground burrows to
protect them both from the hot daytime sun and
from predators. Aardvarks are nocturnal mammals,
only leaving the safety of the burrow under the
cover of night when they go in search of food and
water, often travelling several miles in order to
find the biggest termite mounds guided by their
excellent hearing and sense of smell. Despite
often having a large burrow comprised of an
extensive network of tunnels, aardvarks are also
known to be able to quickly excavate small
temporary burrows where they can protect
themselves quickly rather than having to return
to their original dwelling.
## Aardvark Reproduction and Life Cycles
## Aardvarks have specific mating seasons that
occur every year. Depending on the region in
which the aardvark lives young can be born either
in October to November, or May to June in other
areas. Known to have babies most years, female
aardvarks give birth to a single offspring after
a gestation period that usually lasts for around
7 months. Newborn aardvarks often weigh as little
as 2kg and are born with hairless, pink skin in
the safety of their mother's burrow. Baby
aardvarks spend the first two weeks of their
lives in the safety of the underground burrow
before beginning to venture out with their mother
under the cover of night. However, despite
accompanying their mother in search of food they
aren't weaned until they are around three months
old. Young aardvarks live with their mother in
her burrow until they are around six months old
when they move out to dig a burrow of their own.
Although their lifespan in the wild is not
entirely clear, aardvarks tend to live for more
than 20 years in captivity.
## Aardvark Diet and Prey
## The diet of aardvarks is mainly comprised of
ants and termites, with termites being their
preferred food source. Despite this though, they
are known to also eat other insects such as
beetles and insect larvae. Aardvarks are built to
be insectivores, with strong limbs and claws that
are capable of breaking into the harder outer
shell of termite mounds very efficiently. Once
they have broken into the mound they then use
their long, sticky tongue to harvest the insects
inside and eat them whole without chewing as they
are then ground down in their muscular stomachs.
One of the aardvarks most distinctive features is
the fact that they have columnar cheek-teeth that
serve no functional purpose at all. With some
larger ant species that need to be chewed they
use the incisors that are located towards the
back of their mouths. Aardvarks are also able to
use the same techniques to break into underground
ant nests.
## Aardvark Predators and Threats
## Despite the fact that aardvarks are nocturnal
animals that live in the safety of underground
burrows, they are threatened by a number of
different predators throughout their natural
environment. Lions, leopards, hyenas and large
snakes (most notably pythons) are the main
predators of aardvarks but this does vary
depending on where the aardvark lives. Their main
form of defence is to escape very quickly
underground however, they are also known to be
quite aggressive when threatened by these larger
animals. Aardvarks use their strong, sharp claws
to try and injure their attacker along with
kicking the threatening animal with their
powerful back legs. Aardvarks are also threatened
by humans who hunt them and destroy their natural
habitats.
## Aardvark Interesting Facts and Features
## Aardvarks use their long, sticky tongue to lap
up to 50,000 insects a night from inside termite
mounds or underground ant nests. Their worm-like
tongues can actually grow up to 30 cm in length
meaning they can reach more termites further into
the mound. Their love of insects has actually led
aardvarks also being known as Antbears!
Interestingly enough, aardvarks are also thought
to get almost all of the moisture they need from
their prey meaning that they actually have to
physically drink very little water. Aardvarks are
thought to be one of the world's most prolific
diggers with their strong limbs and claws and
shovel-like feet helping them to be able to shift
2ft of soil in just 15 seconds!
## Aardvark Relationship with Humans
## Due to the fact that they spend the daytime
hours hidden in the safety of their underground
burrows, only emerging under the cover of night
to hunt for food, aardvarks are very seldom seen
by many people. In some regions though, they are
hunted by people for food and are becoming
increasingly affected by expanding human
populations as more of their natural habitats
disappear to make way for growing settlements.
## Aardvark Conservation Status and Life Today
## Today, aardvarks are listed by the IUCN as a
species that is of Least Concern. Despite the
fact that population numbers of aardvarks most
certainly declined in some countries, in others,
their numbers remain stable and they are often
commonly found in both protected areas and
regions with suitable habitats. They are however
becoming increasingly affected by habitat loss in
both the form of deforestation and expanding
towns and villages. Due to their incredibly
elusive nature, exact population sizes are not
fully understood.

# Tokenization

- The process of splitting text in smaller pieces of text (_tokens_)


--


- Most common token == word, but sometimes we tokenize in a different way


--


- An essential part of most text analyses


--


- Many options to take into consideration

# Tokenization considerations

- Should we turn UPPERCASE letters to lowercase?


--


- How should we handle punctuation⁉️


--


- What about non-word characters _inside_ words?


--


- Should compound words be split or multi-word ideas be kept together?

---

class: inverse, right, middle

## Tokenization for English text is typically **much easier** than other languages.

---

# N-grams

## A sequence of `n` sequential tokens

--


- Captures words that appear together often


--


- Can detect negations ("not happy")


--


- Larger cardinality

# 🌷 STEMMING 🌷

# Stemming

Some words are similar (teacher, teachers, teachings, teach) but will be counted seperately

Stemming is the act of removing characters from the end of a word to get the "stem" of the word

This task is HIGHLY language dependent
